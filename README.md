# Django Stuff, with TDD

Hi! In this repo I intend to keep track of my learning of Django using
TDD as an approach for development. It will consistly mostly of doing
usual Django tutorials but forcing myself to use TDD as much as
possible. As I'm still a novice in both of those subjects, I greatly
appreciate criticism if you can share your own experience.

I will use a branch for each tutorial/test, and link them all here in
an index so it's easy to find them.

# The tutorials

1. `poll` - This is Django's [first tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/intro/tutorial03/), which aims to create a polling website with an admin interface so the admin can enter new polls. Still haven't done the last parts that deal with optimization but rough main functionality there and covered by tests.

# Contributing

Help me! Know any interesting Django tutorials and challenges? I'd
be eager to know! Open issues as you will with them and I'll do my
best to answer in the minimun possible time.

# License

Do we really need to? Well, code in this repo is mostly aimed at
learning purposes, as such I believe [MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) license will be the best
choice.
